		I Kopalli Sathvika,D/o Kopalli China Venkateswara Rao and Rajeswari was born on 8th Semptember 2001.I have started my education in 2005 at Vijayarani High School in Kacnchikacherla,Krishna District.Right from my childhood I have been paricipating in various extra curricular activities like dancing,playing games etc which never made me distract over my studies but made me emotionally and physicallu strong.My father who is a teacher in the school I study used to help me and guide in all the ways and had never restricted me for anything that I need.My mother being a home-made helped me in moving in a righteous path and moreover made me much strong by means of cooking my favorite dishes all the time.I have a sister named Sahithya who is now working as a govt employee in our mandal made my childhood much more funniest and the best ever.Being a student who got 10 points in 10th standard, who have studied in a private school is much worried about the seat in IIIT,the news regarding the counselling made her burst into tears and then her RGUKT life has started in IIIT-Ongole later have been transferred to Nuzvid now became a girl who understood different emotions and can be able to some sort of problems and can produly say that she can manage her timings to study.Hope the life goes on happily...
